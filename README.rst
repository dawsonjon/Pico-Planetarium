==================================

The Pi Pico Planetarium is a compact, low-cost astronomy viewer built around
the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W and a 480x320 ST7796 TFT display. Designed with both
beginners and experienced hobbyists in mind, it offers a hands-on introduction
to microcontrollers, electronics, and astronomy, while remaining flexible and
expandable for more advanced use. The device displays a real-time map of the
night sky, including stars, constellations, planets, the Moon, and deep sky
objects. By using Wi-Fi to retrieve accurate time data via NTP, the planetarium
keeps the star chart aligned with the userâ€™s current time and location.

Getting the Code
----------------

.. code::

  git clone https://github.com/dawsonjon/Pico-Planetarium


Documentation
-------------

For technical details refer to the `technical documentation <https://101-things.readthedocs.io/en/latest/planetarium.html>`__.

3D-Printed Enclosure
--------------------

A 3D printed enclosure can be found `here <https://github.com/dawsonjon/Pico-Planetarium/tree/main/enclosure>`__, including stl files and FreeCAD design files.


Install Arduino Pico
--------------------

The SSTV code is written in pure C++, but a demo application is provided as an `Arduino sketch <https://github.com/dawsonjon/Pico-Planetarium/tree/main/pico_planetarium>`__. The `Arduino Pico <https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico>`__ port by Earle Philhower is probably the easiest way to install and configure a C++ development environment for the Raspberry Pi Pico. Its possible to install the tool and get up-and running with example applications in just a few minutes. Refer to the `installation instructions <https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-via-arduino-boards-manager>`__ and the `online documentation <https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ to get started.
